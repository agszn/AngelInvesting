        <h1 class="title-faqPage">Here are some potential advantages of investing in delisted shares:</h1>
        <p class="paragraph1">1. Lower prices: Delisted shares are usually cheaper than their listed counterparts, which
            can make them attractive to investors looking for bargain opportunities and value investing.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">2. Higher returns: In some cases, delisted shares can offer higher returns than their
            listed counterparts because they are less liquid and rarely available, and therefore, less actively traded.
            This means that the price may not fully reflect the underlying value of the company, and there may be
            opportunities for value investing.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">3. Special situations: Companies may delist for a variety of reasons, such as going
            private, merging with another company, or being acquired by a larger entity. These special situations can
            create unique investment opportunities that are not easily available with listed shares.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">4. Reduced regulation: Delisted shares are often subject to less regulatory scrutiny,
            which can be advantageous for investors who are willing to accept higher risk for potentially higher
            rewards.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">5. Potentially undervalued assets: In some cases, delisted shares may still represent
            ownership in valuable assets, such as real estate or intellectual property, that may not be fully reflected
            in the share price. As such, delisted shares can offer a way to invest in undervalued assets that may have
            long-term potential.
        </p>
        <h1 class="title-faqPage">Here are some potential risks involved in investing in delisted shares.:</h1>
        <p class="paragraph1">1. Illiquidity: Delisted shares are usually less liquid than listed shares, which means
            that it can be difficult to find a buyer or seller, and the bid-ask spread may be wider. This can make it
            difficult to sell your delisted shares quickly, which can lead to losses.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">2. Lack of information: Delisted companies may not be required to provide regular
            financial reports and disclosures to the public, which can make it difficult to evaluate the company's
            financial health and future prospects. As such, investing in delisted shares can require more research and
            analysis than investing in listed shares.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">3. High volatility: Delisted shares can be subject to high volatility, as the share price
            may be influenced by a variety of factors, such as news events, rumours, or market sentiment. This can lead
            to significant price swings, which can be difficult to predict or control.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">4. Fraud and scams: Delisted companies may be more vulnerable to fraud and scams, as they
            may be less closely scrutinized by regulators and investors. As such, investors need to be particularly
            careful when investing in delisted shares and do their due diligence to avoid fraudulent or deceptive
            schemes.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">5. Legal and regulatory risks: Delisted companies may be subject to legal and regulatory
            risks, such as lawsuits, fines, or penalties, which can negatively impact the company's financial health and
            future prospects. As such, investors need to be aware of these risks and evaluate them carefully when
            considering investing in delisted shares.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title-faqPage">How to Invest in a Delisted Stock?</h1>
        <p class="paragraph1">At The Angel Investing in a delisted stock can be easy and fast. Here are some steps you can
            take:
        </p>

            diligence and research the company's financials, management, and prospects.

            reports to get more information about the company.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">Determine the price: The price of a delisted stock may be lower than the original value,
